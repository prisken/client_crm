print("1. 🔐 AUTHENTICATION TESTING:")
print("   - Open the app on your device")
print("   - Try creating a new user account")
print("   - Verify login/logout works")
print("   - Check that Firebase Auth is working")
print("")
print("2. 📊 DATA SYNC TESTING:")
print("   - Create some test data (clients, assets, etc.)")
print("   - Check Firebase Console to see if data appears")
print("   - Verify data is stored in user-specific collections")
print("   - Test sync between devices")

print("3. 🔒 USER ISOLATION TESTING:")
print("   - Create User A with email: userA@test.com")
print("   - Add some data as User A")
print("   - Logout and create User B with email: userB@test.com")
print("   - Verify User B sees NO data from User A")
