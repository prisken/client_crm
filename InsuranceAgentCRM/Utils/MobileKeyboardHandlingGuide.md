// Enhanced mobile keyboard handling
VStack {
    // Content
}
.enhancedMobileKeyboardAware(
    extraPadding: 20,
    dismissOnTap: true,
    scrollToActiveField: true
)
```

### Form with Mobile Keyboard Handling
```swift
// Mobile-optimized form
KeyboardAwareForm {
    Section("Details") {
        TextField("Name", text: $name)
        TextField("Email", text: $email)
    }
}
```

### ScrollView with Mobile Keyboard Handling
```swift
// Mobile-optimized scroll view
KeyboardAwareScrollView {
    VStack {
        // Content that needs scrolling
    }
}
```

## Mobile-Specific Modifiers

### 1. mobileKeyboardAware()
- Basic mobile keyboard handling
- Includes tap-to-dismiss functionality

### Animation Handling
- Uses system keyboard animation duration
- Smooth transitions with `withAnimation`
- Proper animation curves for natural feel

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Touch Targets**: All interactive elements meet minimum 44pt touch targets
- **Responsive Sizing**: Components adapt to iPhone vs iPad screen sizes
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated transitions for better user experience
- **Gesture Recognition**: Proper gesture handling for keyboard dismissal

## Testing Checklist
